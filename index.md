### Supervised Learning (Regression Models/ Decision Trees)

- [Diabetes Project](https://github.com/kayla-cho/Diabetes-Project/blob/bf73000b8e218cf5aac442b3a25568762356a535/Project1.ipynb)
  
  Developed a linear regression model to predict the BMI of a patient based on a set of predictor variables. Used variables like BMI to create a logistic regression model to determine if a patient has diabetes.
